# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
The application of engineering principles to build reliable, efficient software.

Importance:
It ensures quality, efficiency, and scalability in software products.
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

1968 NATO Conference: Coined “software engineering.”

Structured Programming (1970s): Improved code organization.

Agile Manifesto (2001): Introduced flexible, iterative development.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Developer: Writes and maintains code.

QA Engineer: Tests for bugs and quality.

Project Manager: Manages timelines and team coordination.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs (e.g., VS Code): Tools for writing/debugging code.

VCS (e.g., Git): Track and manage code changes.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Unclear Requirements: Communicate often.

Scope Creep: Use change control.

Technical Debt: Refactor regularly.

Time Issues: Prioritize tasks.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Tests functions.

Integration: Tests module interaction.

System: Tests whole system.

Acceptance: Validates user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Creating clear, specific prompts to guide AI output effectively.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: “Tell me something about software.”

Improved: “List and explain phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.”
